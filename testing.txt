EUROSHUB-PM (Testing)

0. Default kanban view of projects instead of grid or list.
1. When click on any project card in list, grid or kanban it should navigate to edit page of project.
2. When creating new project their should be also option their to add members in project over their, their should be also option on same new project page or modal to create boards, we can add members and boards after creating new project keep that approach as well, but it will be easier for users to add directly while creating new project. 
3. When boards are created all the members are added into the board which are added in the project, instead user will add members to the board him/herself, like if i create developers board, i will select only developers from the members i have added in the project, in same way if i create designers board i will select designers from added members in project and vice versa.
4. Like I told you about project card, in same way if user clicks on task card, it should open edit task modal.
5. When task is created and assigned to any user like member is selected mail should go to that user, regarding task is assigned along with task details.
6. When creating task, add subtasks as well which will be like checkbox or something like that if any task has 4 subtasks than each task will have 25% completion rate, if one subtask is completed and checked than it means 25% task is complete means the completion rate of task will divide on subtasks if 1 than it will have 100% and viceversa and the completion rate of project will depend on tasks rate so they should be linked and updated correctly.
7. When all the subtasks are completed it mean task is completed than it should automatically move to completed section or done, and when all the tasks are done of project than it means project is completed it should also move or update its status accordingly.
