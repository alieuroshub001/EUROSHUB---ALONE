# Railway Deployment Guide for EurosHub PM Server

## üöÄ Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Prepare MongoDB Database

**Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)**
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Create a free cluster
3. Get your connection string (should look like):
   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/euroshub?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

**Option B: Railway MongoDB Plugin**
1. In your Railway project, go to "Plugins"
2. Add MongoDB plugin
3. Railway will automatically provide `DATABASE_URL`

### 2. Deploy to Railway

1. **Connect to Railway:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   # Install Railway CLI if not installed
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login to Railway
   railway login
   
   # Initialize project
   railway init
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Set MongoDB connection
   railway variables set MONGODB_URI="your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string"
   
   # Set JWT secret
   railway variables set JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key-make-it-long-and-random"
   
   # Set other required variables
   railway variables set NODE_ENV="production"
   railway variables set JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"
   railway variables set JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRE="7"
   
   # Set email configuration (optional but recommended)
   railway variables set EMAIL_SERVICE="gmail"
   railway variables set EMAIL_USERNAME="your-email@gmail.com"
   railway variables set EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
   railway variables set EMAIL_FROM="your-email@gmail.com"
   
   # Set CORS origin (replace with your frontend URL)
   railway variables set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="https://your-frontend-domain.com"
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

### 3. Environment Variables Required

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB connection string | `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/euroshub` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for JWT tokens | `your-super-secret-key-at-least-32-chars` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment | `production` |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | Token expiration | `7d` |
| `JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRE` | Cookie expiration (days) | `7` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Frontend URL for CORS | `https://your-app.vercel.app` |

### 4. Optional Email Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `EMAIL_SERVICE` | Email service (gmail, sendgrid, etc.) |
| `EMAIL_USERNAME` | Email username |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Email password or app password |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | From email address |

### 5. Test Deployment

After deployment, test these endpoints:

- **Health Check:** `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
- **API Base:** `https://your-app.railway.app/api/auth/login`

### 6. Frontend Configuration

Update your frontend `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **MongoDB Connection Failed:**
   - Verify `MONGODB_URI` is correctly set
   - Check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist (allow 0.0.0.0/0 for Railway)
   - Ensure database user has read/write permissions

2. **Environment Variables Not Loading:**
   - Use Railway dashboard to verify variables are set
   - Variables are case-sensitive
   - Redeploy after setting new variables

3. **CORS Issues:**
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your frontend domain
   - Include protocol (https://) in the URL

4. **JWT Issues:**
   - Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set and sufficiently long
   - Check that cookies are being set with correct domain

### Debugging Commands:

```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check environment variables
railway variables

# Open Railway dashboard
railway open
```

## üìù Production Checklist

- [ ] MongoDB database is created and accessible
- [ ] All environment variables are set
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Authentication endpoint works
- [ ] Frontend can connect to API
- [ ] Email service is configured (if using email features)
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS is working

## üöÄ After Deployment

Your API will be available at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

Test the deployment:
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "EurosHub PM API is running successfully",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-11T...",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
