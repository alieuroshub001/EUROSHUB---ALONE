# TRELLO-LIKE BOARDS MODULE - NEW IMPLEMENTATION

## Project Overview
Create a **pure Trello-style board system** separate from the existing project management:
- **Boards** as top-level containers
- **Dynamic Lists/Columns** within boards (user-created)
- **Cards as Projects** - each card represents a complete project
- **Project Modal** opens when clicking cards with full project management

## Key Differences from Current System

### Current System (Project-Centric)
```
Project (main container)
└── Boards (sub-level)
    └── Lists (columns)
        └── Cards (tasks)
```

### New Trello System (Board-Centric)
```
Board (main container)
└── Lists/Columns (user-created)
    └── Cards (projects)
        └── Project Details Modal
            ├── Members
            ├── Tasks/Subtasks
            ├── Files
            ├── Comments
            └── Project Settings
```

## Key Differences from Current System

1. **Boards are primary** - Not nested under projects
2. **Dynamic lists** - Users create custom columns
3. **Cards = Projects** - Each card is a full project
4. **Project modal** - Comprehensive project management in modal
5. **Flexible workflow** - Users define their own process columns

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Users can create boards independently
- [ ] Custom workflow columns work smoothly
- [ ] Project cards contain full project functionality
- [ ] Drag & drop feels natural and responsive
- [ ] Project modal provides complete project management
- [ ] Real-time collaboration works seamlessly
- [ ] Role-based permissions are enforced correctly

This implementation will provide a true Trello-like experience where boards are flexible containers for any workflow, and each card can represent a complete project with its own management interface.
